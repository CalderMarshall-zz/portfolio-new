        <Typography paragraph>
          I spend most of my time at Sharecare building functional React
          components for our web platform. You can view the web platform after
          creating an{' '}

            account

          . My work demands using modern features of Javascript and the
          Ecmascript syntax.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          I also spend a fair amount of time unit testing these components to
          ensure they will work properly. In addition, towards the end of 2019,
          I played a large part in updating certain sections of the Sharecare
          Web Application to meet{' '}

        <Typography paragraph>
          Begrudgingly, this also includes making these views compliant in
          older, less modern browsers. My work at Sharecare also includes
          working with NodeJS servers when necessary.

          I am truly a problem solver at heart, which lends aptitude towards my
          skills as a developer. Outside of work, I spend a large amount of time
          maintaining, repairing, riding, and modifying, my mountain bikes, motorcyle, and car.
