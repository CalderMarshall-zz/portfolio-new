        <Typography paragraph>
          My strength as a developer is the front end. Most of my career has
          been spent building React components for the web. The applications
          I've worked on have often been paired with a Node.js backend. I have
          also worked with Java backend stacks. I advocate and prefer the use of
          modern Javascript features and the Ecmascript syntax. Most recently at
          Helium, I spent time becoming familiar with, and building features in
          Typescript.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          I advocate unit testing for front front end components. I've held
          roles where developers are responsible for maintaining quality, and
          I've also worked with Quality Assurance departments. I'm also
          comfortable supporting applications in older, less compliant browsers.
          At Sharecare, I played a large part in updating the Health Profile

          I am truly a problem solver at heart, which lends aptitude towards my
          skills as a developer. Outside of work, I spend hours tackling more
          physical engineering challenges. Mainly working on cars, bicycles, and
          motorbikes.
